- 🎲 **Deterministic Simulations** - Shareable URLs with seed parameters for reproducible results
- 🔗 **One-Click Sharing** - Share simulation results with a single click via URL
- 📥 **Export Results** - Download simulation data as CSV or JSON for analysis
- 🎨 **Accessibility Themes** - Choose from default, colorblind-friendly, or high-contrast color schemes

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rcv-voting-sim.git
cd rcv-voting-sim

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

Built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## How It Works

### 1. Enter Your Ballot
Rank up to 4 candidates in order of preference. You can rank as many or as few as you'd like.

### 2. Simulate the Election
The app generates a realistic electorate using a spatial voting model:
- Voters are distributed in 2D ideological space using Gaussian clusters
- Each voter ranks candidates based on proximity (with realistic noise)
- Ballot completion rates mirror real elections (10% rank 1, 40% rank all)

### 3. Run RCV Algorithm
The simulator implements Fort Collins instant-runoff voting rules:
- **Majority**: A candidate wins when they receive >50% of continuing ballots
- **Elimination**: The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated each round
- **Transfers**: Eliminated candidate's votes transfer to next preferences
- **Tie-Breaking**: Uses "lookback-then-lot" strategy (compares prior rounds, then random lot)

### 4. Visualize Results
- **Sankey Diagram**: Shows vote flow between rounds
- **Bar Charts**: Round-by-round tallies with majority threshold
- **Exhaustion Analysis**: Breakdown of exhausted ballots (overvotes, no valid next choice, blanks)
- **Your Ballot Path**: Highlights your ballot's journey through the count

### 5. Share & Export
- **Share Link**: Copy the simulation URL to share exact results with others
- **CSV Export**: Download round-by-round tallies and exhaustion data for spreadsheet analysis
- **JSON Export**: Full simulation data including candidates, metadata, and all round details

### 6. Accessibility
Three color schemes available:
- **Default**: Standard color palette
- **Colorblind-Friendly**: Deuteranopia/protanopia safe colors
- **High Contrast**: WCAG AAA compliant for maximum readability

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe code throughout
- **Vite** - Fast development and optimized builds
- **D3.js** - Data-driven visualizations (Sankey diagrams, charts)
- **Vitest** - Unit testing framework
- **seedrandom** - Deterministic random number generation

No framework dependencies (React, Vue, etc.) - pure TypeScript with vanilla DOM manipulation for minimal bundle size and maximum control.

```

## Configuration

The simulator uses environment variables for configuration. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize:

```bash
# Default seed for reproducible simulations
VITE_DEFAULT_SEED=

# Number of simulated voters (100-50000)
VITE_DEFAULT_VOTER_COUNT=5000

# Enable debug logging
VITE_DEBUG_MODE=false
```

See [ENV_CONFIG.md](ENV_CONFIG.md) for complete documentation of all environment variables.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- rcv.test.ts
```

Tests cover:
- Core RCV algorithm correctness
- Tie-breaking logic
- Ballot exhaustion scenarios
- Edge cases (immediate majority, full exhaustion, etc.)

## Deployment

This is a static single-page application with no backend. Deploy to any static hosting platform:

**Recommended Platforms:**
- **Netlify** - Drag & drop the `dist/` folder
- **Vercel** - Run `npx vercel` or connect via Git
- **GitHub Pages** - Run `npm run deploy`
- **Surge** - Run `npx surge dist/`

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed platform-specific instructions.

## Educational Use

This simulator is designed for:
- **Voters** learning how RCV works before an election
- **Teachers** demonstrating voting theory and election methods
- **Civic organizations** explaining RCV to community members
- **Researchers** exploring spatial voting models and preference patterns

### Shareable Simulations

Every simulation has a unique URL with the random seed parameter. Share the link to let others see the exact same election:

```
https://your-domain.com/#/sim?seed=abc123&n=5000
```

## RCV Rules Implemented

This simulator follows Fort Collins, Colorado RCV rules:

1. **Majority Threshold**: Strictly greater than 50% of continuing ballots
2. **Single Elimination**: One candidate eliminated per round (no batch elimination)
3. **Tie-Breaking**: "Lookback-then-lot" strategy
   - Compare tied candidates' tallies in prior rounds (most recent to earliest)
   - Eliminate candidate with lowest prior-round tally
   - If tied in all prior rounds, use random lot (seeded for reproducibility)
4. **Ballot Exhaustion**: Ballots exhaust when:
   - They contain an overvote (multiple candidates ranked equally)
   - All remaining preferences are for eliminated candidates
   - Only blank/null ranks remain

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
